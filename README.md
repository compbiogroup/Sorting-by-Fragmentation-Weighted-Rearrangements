# Algorithms for problems of Sorting Permutations by Fragmentation-Weighted Rearrangements

Makefile options:

- generate-signed: program to generate random signed permutations with maximum number of breakpoints.
- generate-unsigned: program to generate random unsigned permutations with maximum number of breakpoints.
- generate-small-signed: program to generate all small (n < 11) signed permutations.
- generate-small-unsigned: program to generate all small (n < 11) unsigned permutations.
- oneperm: approximation algorithms for problems of sorting permutations by fragmentation-weighted rearrangements that receives a single permutation as input.
- file: approximation algorithms for problems of sorting. permutations by fragmentation-weighted rearrangements that receives a file with many permutations as input.
- lb: calculate the lower bound for the input instances.

For each program, use the help option -h to see usage details.
Ex: ./prog -h
